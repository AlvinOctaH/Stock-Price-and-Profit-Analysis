The cases of Tesla and GameStop offer an interesting perspective on how market expectations and investor activity can influence stock prices, regardless of the company's fundamentals. In the case of Tesla, many investors engaged in short selling with the expectation that the stock price would fall. However, as Tesla's profitability increased, the stock price surged, resulting in losses for investors who had shorted the stock.
On the other hand, the GameStop case demonstrates a unique phenomenon where massive demand from individual investors on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets drove a surge in GameStop's stock price, despite the company experiencing losses. This resulted in significant losses for hedge funds that had shorted GameStop's stock.
