## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This repository will discuss financial data analysis and stock price movements for two companies, Tesla and GameStop, with a primary focus on understanding the dynamics of short selling and investor behavior. Understanding the factors that influence stock prices, such as company profits and growth prospects, is crucial in determining the appropriate investment strategy.

The cases of Tesla and GameStop offer an interesting perspective on how market expectations and investor activity can influence stock prices, regardless of the company's fundamentals. In the case of Tesla, many investors engaged in short selling with the expectation that the stock price would fall. However, as Tesla's profitability increased, the stock price surged, resulting in losses for investors who had shorted the stock.
On the other hand, the GameStop case demonstrates a unique phenomenon where massive demand from individual investors on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets drove a surge in GameStop's stock price, despite the company experiencing losses. This resulted in significant losses for hedge funds that had shorted GameStop's stock.
